    <b>WHAT I'VE LEARNED</b><br>

<p>A <b>webpage</b> is an html document that can be read and displayed on a web browser; they are usually about cats doing funny things, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVo3LbVWjWc">this</a>. Knock yourself out, I'll wait.</p>

<p><b>Coding</b> is how programmers instruct computers to do things.</p>

<p><b>Computers are stupid</b>, so programmers need to be very precise about typing their instructions.<p>

<p>Programmers <b>don't need to remember everything</b>, just some basics ideas. The details can always be googled.
  
<p><b>Basic HTML Vocabulary</b>, such as <b>tags</b>, <b>elements</b> (which can be <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>), and <b>attributes</b>.
